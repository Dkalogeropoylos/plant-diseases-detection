The aim of this work is to identify different diseases in different field plants using deep learning prediction models. The dataset used has three different classes and a total of 1422 images for training 60 for validation and 150 for test . The process starts with preprocessing the data where various inductions were explored. Then different models of different types were tested. In particular, different architectures of known models with different freezings were explored as well as a model built from scratch. In addition, different studies that had demonstrated the best preprocessing model for this task were checked.
Finally, different calibration techniques were applied to the different models and the extent to which this process helped their performance was investigated.
